This is a demonstration of different approaches to testing Redux Sagas.
Have a look at [this blog post](https://dev.to/phil/the-best-way-to-test-redux-sagas-4hib) for an explanation!

See `sagas-step-by-step.test.js` and `sagas-whole.test.js` for the examples.

Use `npm start` to load the app, and add the Chrome Redux Devtools to see the actions that get logged.
